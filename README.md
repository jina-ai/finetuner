Finetuner allows you to perform experiments for tuning deep neural networks for better embeddings on search tasks. It
accompanies [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) to deliver the last mile of performance for domain-specific neural search
applications.

üéõ **Designed for finetuning**: a deep learning client for leveling up your pretrained models in domain-specific neural search applications.

üç∞ **Easy to use**: fine-tuning with Finetuner is a piece of cake! Easily create your fine-tuning experiments and runs in just a few lines of code.

üî± **Simple yet powerful**: although interacting with the Finetuner is really simple, it nonetheless supports rich features such as
siamese/triplet loss, metric learning, self-supervised pretraining, layer pruning, weights freezing, dimensionality reduction, and much more!

üßà **DocArray integration**: buttery smooth integration with DocArray, reducing the cost of a context-switch between experiment
and production.
