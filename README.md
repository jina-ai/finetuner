Fine-tuning deep neural networks (DNNs) significantly improves performance on domain specific neural search tasks.
However, fine-tuning for neural search is not trivial, as it requires a combination of expertise in ML and Information Retrieval.
Finetuner makes fine-tuning simple and fast by handling all related complexity and infrastructure in the cloud. With Finetuner, you can easily make models more performant and production ready.

üìà**Performance boost**: Finetuner significantly increases the performance of pretrained models on domain specific neural search applications.

üî± **Simple yet powerful**: Interacting with Finetuner is simple and seamless, and also supports rich features such as selections of different loss functions, e.g. 
siamese/triplet loss, metric learning, layer pruning, weights freezing, dimensionality reduction, and much more.

‚òÅ **Fine-tune in the cloud**: Finetuner runs your fine-tuning jobs in the cloud. You never have to worry about provisioning (cloud) resources! Finetuner handles all related complexity and infrastructure.

## How does it work?

<img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner/blob/docs-update-readme/docs/_static/finetuner-client-journey.svg?raw=true" title="Finetuner Client user journey.">

## [Documentation](https://finetuner.jina.ai/)

## Install

Requires Python 3.7+.

```bash
pip install -U finetuner
```

## Get Started

The following code block illustrates how to fine-tune ResNet50 on [Totally Looks Like dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/totally-looks-like-dataset)
```python
import finetuner
from finetuner.callback import EvaluationCallback

finetuner.login()

run = finetuner.fit(
    model='resnet50',
    train_data='tll-train-da',
    callbacks=[EvaluationCallback(query_data='tll-eval-da')],
)

print(run.status())
print(run.logs())

run.save_model('resnet-tll')
```

This minimal example code starts a fine-tuning run with only the necessary arguments. It has the following steps:

  * Login to Finetuner: This is necessary if you'd like to run fine-tuning jobs with Finetuner in the cloud.
  * Start fine-tuning run: Select backbone model, training and evaluation data for your evaluation callback.
  * Monitor: Check the status and logs of the progress on your fine-tuning run.
  * Save model: If your fine-tuning run has successfully completed, save it for further use and integration.
