# Finetuning Pretrained ResNet for Celebrity Face Search

```{tip}
For this example, you will need a GPU machine to enable the best experience.
```

In this example, we want to "tune" the pre-trained [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) on [CelebA dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). Note that, the original weights of the ResNet model was trained on ImageNet.

The Finetuner will work in the following steps: 
- first, we spawn the Labeler that helps us to inspect the top-K visually similar celebrities face images from original ResNet;
- then, with the Labeler UI we accept or reject the results based on their similarities;
- finally, the results are collected at the backend by the Tuner, which "tunes" the ResNet and produces better search result.

Hopefully the procedure converges after several rounds; and we get a tuned embedding for better celebrity face search.

## Prepare CelebA data

Let's first make sure you have downloaded all the images [`img_align_celeba.zip`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7EVK8r0v71pZjFTYXZWM3FlRnM/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-dYn9z10tMJOBAkviAcfdyQ) and [`IdentityCelebA.txt`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ee_0u7vcNLOfNLegJRHmolfH5ICW-XS/view?usp=sharing) locally.

```{caution}
Beware that the original CelebA dataset is 1.3GB. In this example, we do not need the full dataset. Here is a smaller version which contains 1000 images from the original dataset. You can [download it from here](https://static.jina.ai/celeba/celeba-img.zip).
```

Note that Finetuner accepts Jina `DocumentArray`/`DocumentArrayMemmap`, so we first load CelebA data into this format using generator:

```python
from jina.types.document.generators import from_files


def data_gen():
    # please change the file path to your data path
    for d in from_files('/Users/jina/Downloads/img_align_celeba/*.jpg', size=100, to_dataturi=True):
        d.convert_image_datauri_to_blob(color_axis=0)  # no need of tf
        yield d
```

## Load the pretrained model

Let's import pretrained ResNet50 as our base model. ResNet50 is implemented in PyTorch, Keras and Paddle. You can choose whatever framework you feel comfortable:

````{tab} PyTorch
```python
import torchvision

model = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
```
````
````{tab} Keras
```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
```
````
````{tab} Paddle
```python
import paddle

model = paddle.vision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
```
````


## Put together

Finally, let's start the Finetuner. Note that we freeze the weights of the original ResNet and tuned only for the last linear layer, which leverages Tailor underneath:

```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 5, 8
---
import finetuner

finetuner.fit(
    model=model,
    interactive=True,
    train_data=data_gen,
    freeze=True,
    to_embedding_model=True,
    input_size=(3, 224, 224),
    output_dim=100
)
```

Note that how we specify `interactive=True` and `to_embedding_model=True` in the above code to activate Labler and Tailor, respectively.

`input_size` is not required when you using Keras as the backend.

## Label interactively

After running the script, the browser will open the Labeler UI. You can now label the data by mouse/keyboard. The model will get trained and improved as you are labeling. If you are running this example on a CPU machine, it can take up to 20 seconds for each labeling round.

```

On the backend, you should be able to see the training procedure in the terminal.
