# {octicon}`rocket` Jina Embeddings

Starting with Finetuner 0.8.0,
we have introduced a suite of pre-trained text embedding models licensed under Apache 2.0.
These models have a variety of use cases, including information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, text reranking, and more.
The suite consists of the following models:

- `jina-embedding-t-en-v1` [**[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embedding-t-en-v1)**]: The fastest embedding model in the world with 14 million parameters.
- `jina-embedding-s-en-v1` [**[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embedding-s-en-v1)**]: This is a compact model with just 35 million parameters, that performs lightning-fast inference while delivering impressive performance.
- `jina-embedding-b-en-v1` [**[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embedding-b-en-v1)**]: This model has a size of 110 million parameters, performs fast inference and delivers better performance than our smaller model.
- `jina-embedding-l-en-v1` [**[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embedding-l-en-v1)**]: This is a relatively large model with a size of 330 million parameters, that performs single-gpu inference and delivers better performance than the other models.

## Usage

```python
import finetuner

model = finetuner.build_model('jinaai/jina-embedding-s-en-v1')
embeddings = finetuner.encode(
    model=model,
    data=['how is the weather today', 'What is the current weather like today?']
)
print(finetuner.cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]))
```

## Training Data

Jina Embeddings is a suite of language models that have been trained using Jina AI's Linnaeus-Clean dataset.
This dataset consists of 380 million query-document pairs of sentences.
These pairs were obtained from various domains and were carefully selected through a thorough cleaning process.
The Linnaeus-Full dataset, from which the Linnaeus-Clean dataset is derived, originally contained 1.6 billion sentence pairs.

## Characteristics

Each Jina embedding model can encode up to 512 tokens,
with any further tokens being truncated.
The models have different output dimensionalities, as shown in the table below:

| Name                   | param |context| Dimension |
|------------------------|-------|------|-----------|
| jina-embedding-t-en-v1 | 14m   |512| 312       |
| jina-embedding-s-en-v1 | 35m   |512| 512       |
| jina-embedding-b-en-v1 | 110m  |512| 768       |
| jina-embedding-l-en-v1 | 330m  |512| 1024      |
