        "Finding similar 3D Meshes can become very time-consuming. To support this task, one can build search systems. To directly search on the 3D meshes without relying on metadata one can use an encoder model which creates a point cloud from the mesh and encode it into vector dense representations which can be compared to each other. To enable those models to detect the right attributes of a 3D mesh, this tutorial shows you how to use Finetuner to train and use a model for a 3D mesh search system."
