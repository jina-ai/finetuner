# Text to image search using CLIP

This guide will showcase fine-tuning a `CLIP` model for text to image retrieval.

## Task overview
We'll be fine-tuning CLIP on a fashion captioning dataset which contains information about fashion products.

For each product the dataset contains a title and images of multiple variants of the product. We constructed a parent `Document` for each picture, which contains two chunks: an image document and a text document holding the description of the product.


## Preparing data
Training and evaluation data are already prepared and pushed to Hubble following the [instructions](../2_step_by_step/2_4_create_training_data.md).
You can either pull the data:
```python
from docarray import DocumentArray
train_data = DocumentArray.pull('clip-fashion-train-data')
eval_data = DocumentArray.pull('clip-fashion-eval-data')
```
Or specify given `DocumentArray` names (`clip-fashion-train-data` and `clip-fashion-eval-data`) directly to finetuner.


## Login to Finetuner
As explained in the [Login to Jina ecosystem](../2_step_by_step/2_3_login_to_jina_ecosystem.md) section, first we need to login to Jina Cloud:
```python
import finetuner
finetuner.login()
```


## Choosing the model
Currently, we only support `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` for text to image retrieval tasks. However, you can see all available models either in [the docs](../2_step_by_step/2_5_choose_back_bone.md) or by calling `finetuner.describe_models()`.


## Creating a fine-tuning job
Now that everything's ready, let's create a fine-tuning run!

```python
from finetuner.callback import BestModelCheckpoint, EvaluationCallback

run = finetuner.fit(
        model='openai/clip-vit-base-patch32',
        run_name='clip-fashion',
        train_data='clip-fashion-train-data',
        eval_data='clip-fashion-eval-data',
        epochs=5,
        learning_rate= 1e-5,
        callbacks=[BestModelCheckpoint(), EvaluationCallback(query_data='clip-fashion-eval-data')],
        loss='CLIPLoss',
        image_modality='image',
        text_modality='text',
        multi_modal=True,
    )
```
Let's understand what this piece of code does.
We start with providing `model`, `run_name`, names of training and evaluation data. We also provide some hyper-parameters
such as number of `epochs` and a `learning_rate`. Additionally, we use `BestModelCheckpoint` to save the best model after each epoch and `EvaluationCallback` for evaluation. Now let's move on to CLIP-specific arguments. We provided `image_modality`
and `text_modality` which are needed for `CLIP` model to distribute data across its two models properly. (More on this in the [create training data](../2_step_by_step/2_4_create_training_data.md) section).
We also need to provide a `CLIPloss` and set `multi_modal` to `True`.


## Monitor your runs

We created a run! Now let's see its status.
```python
print(run.status())
```

```bash
{'status': 'CREATED', 'details': 'Run submitted and awaits execution'}
```

Since some runs might take up to several hours/days, it's important to know how to reconnect to Finetuner and retrieve your run.

```python
import finetuner
finetuner.login()
run = finetuner.get_run('clip-fashion')
```

You can continue monitoring the run by checking the status - `run.status()` or the logs - `run.logs()`. 


## Save your model

If your run has finished successfully, you can save fine-tuned models in the following way:
```python
run.save_model('clip-model')
```

## Evaluation and performance
Currently, we don't have a user-friendly way to get evaluation metrics from the `EvaluationCallback` we initialized previously.
What you can do for now is to call `run.logs()` in the end of the run and see evaluation results:
